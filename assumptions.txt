UTCDATE is the standard time we use to compare date-times
Auction Period - 2023-11-13 00:00:00 until 2023-11-26 23:59:59
Maximum Start Date to insert the product to Auction 2023-11-26 23:59:00
Store procedures were designed to ease admin errors, such as:
	1. To insertions before starting the Auction period - The start time to accept bids will be 2023-11-13
	

Auction.uspAddProductToAuction
	1- CustomerID needs to exist
	2- ProductID constraints to be added to the auction
		a. ProductID exists
		b. ProductID SellEndDate NULL
		c. ProductID DiscontinuedDate NULL
		d. ProductID exists in stock
		e. Only one Auction with Active Status can exist per ProductID can be in the Auction
	3- Date constraints/assumptions
		a. ExpireDate higher that the start of the Auction period (2023-11-13 00:00:00)
		b. ExpireDate should be higher than the current date given by GETUTCDATE()
		c. The date of insert given by the GETUTCDATE() function needs to be lower than the end of the Auction Period
		d. ExpireDate will be the end of the Auction Period if the given or default ExpireDate is higher than the end of the Auction Period
		e. If a product is inserted before the start of the Auction period the start time to accept bids will be 2023-11-13 00:00:00, and the product will be accepted if all other constraints were passed
		f. A product can only be added to auction no later than 2023-11-26 23:59:59
	4- Money constraints/assumptions
		a. If InitialBid is lower than the limit then it will be correct to the minimum allowed and accept
		b. If InitialBid is higher than the limit then it will be transformed in (ListPrice*MaxAuctionPrice - MinnimumIncreaseBid) to allow one bid
Auction.uspTryBidProduct
	1- Product constraints/assumptions
		a. Product needs to be added in the AuctionedProducted to accept bids
	2- Date constraints/assumptions
		a. Only products with status active can be bidded and GETUTCDATE() needs to be lower than the ExpireDate
		b. Bids are only accepted if GETUTCDATE() is higher than the StartDate of the auction of the bidded product
	3- Money constraints/assumptions
		a. A product only accepts bids until the amount of the current bid plus the increase is lower than the list price (e.g. for cases of BidAmount IS NULL - ListPrice = 10, current bid=9,96, default increase = 0,05; the bid will not be accepted)
